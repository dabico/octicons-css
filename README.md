# Octicons CSS

I don't like that Primer dropped their CSS distribution of [octicons](https://github.com/primer/octicons).
For this reason I constructed my own pipeline for converting the SVGs they distribute into stylesheets.

Including the icons in your own website is easy, just add the following to your website header:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/octicons-css/octicons.min.css">
```
